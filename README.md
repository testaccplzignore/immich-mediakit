## Version Compatibility

**Important**: Different versions of MediaKit are compatible with different versions of Immich due to database schema changes.

| MediaKit Version | Compatible Immich Version | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------|
| 0.1.9 and below | Immich ≤ 1.135.3 | Uses plural table names (assets, users, albums) |
| 0.1.10 and above | Immich ≥ 1.136.0 | Uses singular table names (asset, user, album) |

**Database Schema Changes:**
- Immich v1.136.0 introduced significant database schema changes, switching from plural to singular table names
- MediaKit versions have been updated to match these changes
- Using mismatched versions will result in database connection errors

**How to check your Immich version:**
1. Open your Immich web interface
2. Go to Settings → About
3. Check the version number displayed

**Upgrade Path:**
- If upgrading Immich from pre-1.136.0 to 1.136.0 or later, you must also upgrade MediaKit to version 0.1.10 or later
- If you need to stay on an older Immich version, use MediaKit 0.1.9

---

## How It Works

1. Fetches Users & Assets data from the Immich PostgreSQL database
2. Processes images through ResNet152 to extract feature vectors
3. Stores vectors in the Qdrant vector database
4. Uses vector similarity to identify similar/duplicate photos
5. Displays similar photo groups based on the configured threshold
6. Manages asset deletion by updating Immich database directly:
   - Follows Immich's deletion logic for compatibility
   - **Important**: Enable trash feature in Immich settings first
   - Deleted assets appear in Immich's trash where you can permanently delete or restore them



## Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

- `Find Similar`
  - Starts searching for the next photo that matches your `Threshold Min` settings and shows it in the `current` tab
  - When photo groups appear in the `current` tab, you can click on a photo's header to select it. This lights up the four action buttons on the top right. After using one of these actions, the kept photos in that group will be marked as resolved
  - If you don't do anything with a searched group, it'll show up in the `pending` tab waiting for you to handle it later

- `Clear records & Keep resolved`
  - Clears out search records that haven't been resolved yet
  - This keeps all the records you've already marked as resolved

- `Reset records`
  - Resets all search records, including the ones you've marked as resolved


### Search Configuration

- `Exclude Settings`
  - **Similar Less**: Auto-resolve groups with fewer than N similar photos and continue search
    - Example: Setting "< 2" means skip groups with 1 or 0 similar photos (requires at least 3 total photos)
    - Useful for focusing only on groups with enough duplicates to warrant attention
  - **NameFilter**: Exclude specific files from similarity search by filename patterns or extensions
    - **Extension format**: `.png,.gif,.dng` - Files with these extensions won't be selected as main image or appear in similar results
    - **Filename pattern**: `IMG_,DSC,screenshot` - Files containing these patterns will be excluded
    - **Mixed format**: `.png,IMG_,screenshot` - Combine extensions and patterns
    - **Use case**: Perfect for drone photography where you shoot both RAW (.dng) and JPEG simultaneously but want to keep both formats without them being flagged as duplicates

- Make the most of `Auto Selection`
  - When you enable auto selection, it'll automatically choose which photos to keep or delete after you run `Find Similar`. Just scroll through to review, then hit one of the four action buttons at the top

- `Multi Mode` search feature
  - By default (when `Multi Mode` is off), it only searches for one group of photos at a time
  - Turn this on and set the `Max Group` number when you've got tons of photos to filter through - super handy for big cleanups
  - **Note: Multi Mode and Related Tree are mutually exclusive**

- `Related Tree`
  - **Only available in single group mode (when Multi Mode is off)**
  - When `Related Tree` is off, `Find Similar` only shows photos directly related to the main photo
  - Turn it on and it'll also search for photos related to those related photos, creating a comprehensive similarity tree
  - **Cannot be used together with Multi Mode for performance and clarity reasons**
  - `MaxItems` limits how deep the search goes. Say you set the threshold to `(0.5, 1)` - that might trigger endless searching if you have 100k photos, so this cap keeps things under control
  - Note: The number of photos directly related to the main photo isn't limited by `MaxItems`

**Mode Selection**: Choose Single Mode + Related Tree for comprehensive similarity trees, or Multi Mode for quick processing of multiple separate groups.

### Advanced Strategies

- **Progressive cleaning approach**
  - Start with the highest similarity threshold and work your way down:
    - First, get rid of exact duplicates `(0.97-1.00)`
    - Then find near-duplicates `(0.90-0.97)`
    - Finally, catch similar but different shots `(0.80-0.90)`
  - This way you tackle the obvious duplicates first, then deal with the photos that need more careful judgment

- **Clear and rescan strategy**
  - Before changing your threshold settings, use `Reset Records` to wipe all similarity data
  - This lets you rescan all photos with new thresholds and avoid missing anything or getting false matches

- **Auto Selection optimization**
  - Configure selection criteria: FileSize +3 for higher quality, Name Longer +3 for descriptive filenames
  - Review auto-selected results before batch processing

- **Large collection tips**
  - For 8000+ photos: Enable Multi Mode with appropriate Max Group settings
  - Use batch operations for efficiency

- **External library considerations**
  - Ensure external library paths are not set to read-only if using Docker Compose
  - Enable Immich's recycle bin feature before processing external libraries
  - Remember that MediaKit reads from Immich thumbnails, so original file locations don't affect similarity detection

## System Startup

When MediaKit starts up, it performs several system checks as shown below:

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/chk.gif" alt="System startup checks" />
</p>

**Important startup notes:**
- Pay attention to the startup messages displayed during initialization
- The system will show proper status indicators and perform version checks
- If any components are outdated or incompatible, you'll receive update prompts
- Ensure all checks pass before proceeding with operations

If you encounter any startup errors or version mismatches, follow the update instructions above or check the logs for detailed error information.

## Logging

MediaKit automatically logs system operations and errors to help with troubleshooting.

**Log Location:**
- Logs are stored in the `MKIT_DATA/logs/` directory
- Log files are rotated daily for better organization

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior, check the log files in the logs directory
- The logs contain detailed information about system operations, errors, and warnings
- Log files can help identify configuration issues, database connection problems, or processing errors

## Installation & Setup

### Installation Method Selection Guide

Choose the installation method that suits your needs:

| Installation Method | Use Case | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---------------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Docker Compose (CPU)** | Quick trial, most users | One-click install, auto Qdrant setup | CPU processing only |
| **Docker Compose (GPU)** | Linux users with NVIDIA GPU | One-click install, auto Qdrant setup, GPU acceleration | Linux + NVIDIA GPU only |
| **Source Installation** | Custom environment, development | Multi-platform GPU support (CUDA/MPS), customizable | Manual Qdrant and dependency setup |

**Recommended Choice:**
- 🚀 **Most users**: Use Docker Compose (CPU version)
- ⚡ **Linux users with NVIDIA GPU**: Use Docker Compose (GPU version)
- 🍎 **macOS users needing GPU**: Use source installation (MPS support)
- 🔧 **Custom development or specific requirements**: Use source installation

### Prerequisites

- Access to an Immich installation with trash feature enabled
- A configured `.env` file (see below)

### Set up your Immich database
Before you can use mediakit, you need to set your database up, so MediaKit can connect to it. This explanation covers only Immich installations via docker compose.

#### Immich on the same host as mediakit
If your Immich installation is on the same machine than you want to install MediaKit on, a docker network can be used to connect to the db.
To create the network execute the following command (on the host, not in the docker container):
```bash
docker network create immich-mediakit
```

Then add the network to your immich database container and to the docker compose:
```yaml
services:
  database:
    container_name: immich_postgres
    image: ghcr.io/immich-app/postgres:14-vectorchord0.3.0-pgvectors0.2.0
    networks: # Add the immich-mediakit network to the db to allow immich-mediakit to access the db
      - immich-mediakit


networks: # Add the immich-mediakit network to the immich docker compose without any indentation
  immich-mediakit:
    external: true
```

After updating, restart Immich to apply the changes. The `PSQL_HOST` in your `.env` file should match the container name of the database.

#### Immich on a different host as mediakit
If your Immich installation is on a different machine than you want to install MediaKit on, you need to expose the PostgreSQL port. Note that this exposes your database to anyone in the hosts network, so use a secure password!
Add the following port mapping to your Immich's docker compose:

```yaml
services:
  database:
    container_name: immich_postgres
    image: ghcr.io/immich-app/postgres:14-vectorchord0.3.0-pgvectors0.2.0
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Add this line to expose PostgreSQL
```

After updating, restart Immich to apply the changes. The exposed port (5432 in this example) should match the `PSQL_PORT` setting in your MediaKit `.env` file.


### Option 1: Docker Compose
Using Docker Compose is the easiest installation method, automatically including the Qdrant vector database.

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Copy Docker Configuration Files**

   The compose has a few differences when you're installing MediaKit on the same host vs on a different host than Immich. Choose the same as you have for setting up the database.

   **Same host configuration:**
   - [docker-compose.yml](./docker/same-host/docker-compose.yml)
   - [docker-compose-immich.yml](./docker/same-host/docker-compose-immich.yml)
   - [.env](./docker/same-host/.env)

   **Different host configuration:**
   - [docker-compose.yml](./docker/different-host/docker-compose.yml)
   - [docker-compose-immich.yml](./docker/different-host/docker-compose-immich.yml)
   - [.env](./docker/different-host/.env)

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Choose the appropriate `.env` file based on your setup and modify:
   - `PSQL_HOST`: Database connection (service name for same-host, IP address for different-host)
   - `IMMICH_PATH`: Path to your Immich upload directory  
   - `IMMICH_THUMB`: (Optional) Path for separate thumbnail directory (requires additional volume mount)
   - `MKIT_DATA`: Directory for MediaKit data storage
   - `QDRANT_URL`: (Optional) Custom Qdrant database URL for non-Docker environments or custom container setups

3. **Create Docker Network (Same-host only)**

   If using same-host setup, create the shared network:
   ```bash
   docker network create immich-mediakit
   ```

4. **Update Immich Configuration (Required)**

   Modify your existing Immich docker-compose.yml file according to the example provided:
   - **Same-host**: Add networks configuration to enable communication
   - **Different-host**: Expose PostgreSQL port for external access

5. **Choose CPU or GPU Version**

   **CPU Version (Default):**
   The default configuration uses the CPU-only image:
   ```yaml
   image: razgrizhsu/immich-mediakit:latest
   ```
   No additional configuration needed.

   **GPU Version (Linux + NVIDIA GPU only):**
   
   To use NVIDIA GPU acceleration, edit your `docker-compose.yml`:
   
   a. Change the image to the CUDA version:
   ```yaml
   image: razgrizhsu/immich-mediakit:latest-cuda
   ```
   
   b. Uncomment the deploy configuration:
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     resources:
       reservations:
         devices:
           - driver: nvidia
             count: 1
             capabilities: [gpu]
   ```
   
   **Prerequisites for GPU:**
   - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
   - NVIDIA Docker runtime installed
   - Linux host system
   
   **Note:** Docker GPU support is Linux + NVIDIA only. For macOS MPS or Windows GPU acceleration, use source installation.

6. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

7. **Access Application**
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:8086`

8. **Updating MediaKit**
   To update MediaKit when using Docker Compose, run:
   ```bash
   docker compose down && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
   ```


### Option 2: Source Installation
For custom environments and development needs.

**Use Cases:**
- Want to customize Python environment
- Need to modify source code
- Prefer manual control over dependencies

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Install Qdrant Server**
   ```bash
   # Install Qdrant using Docker
   docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
   ```

2. **Clone Source Code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RazgrizHsu/immich-mediakit.git
   cd immich-mediakit
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create `.env` file and set connection information (refer to the example above)

4. **Install Python Dependencies**
   
   **CPU version (default):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **GPU acceleration:**
   ```bash
   # Linux with NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)
   pip install -r requirements-cuda.txt
   
   # macOS with Apple Silicon (MPS)
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # PyTorch auto-detects MPS support
   
   # Windows with NVIDIA GPU
   pip install -r requirements-cuda.txt
   ```

   **Platform-specific notes:**
   - **Linux**: Install CUDA drivers and corresponding PyTorch version first
   - **macOS**: Apple Silicon automatically supports MPS acceleration
   - **Windows**: Requires NVIDIA GPU and CUDA drivers
   - May need additional system packages: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev libffi-dev` (Linux)

5. **Start Application**
   ```bash
   python -m src.app
   ```

## Developer Notes

Initially, I was planning to build this with Electron + React frontend + Node.js backend, but given how much easier it is to integrate machine learning stuff with Python, I ended up going the Python route.

I usually use Gradio for quick AI demos, but it gets pretty limiting when you want more customization. Same story with Streamlit - they're great for prototypes but not so flexible for complex UIs. After trying a bunch of different options, I settled on Dash by Plotly. Sure, it still needs a lot of custom work to get exactly what I want, but it gets the job done pretty well.

What started as a simple little tool to help me clean up duplicate photos somehow turned into this whole complex system... funny how these things grow, right?

Hope this tool helps anyone who's dealing with the same photo organization headaches! :)
